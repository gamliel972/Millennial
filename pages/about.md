Hi there! I'm that guy known as Gamliel. Iâ€™m a Computer System Engineer turned Ethical Hacker, CTF player and Bug Bounty participant. I'm participating mostly on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity) and giving a try on [BugCrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/), I have pursued ethical hacking as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my profile in HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/gamliel) for more information about the companies I've helped on by reporting bug/failures in their systems/platforms, and of course take a look [here at GitHub pages] where I write about how I solved some technical issues (mostly personal references).
